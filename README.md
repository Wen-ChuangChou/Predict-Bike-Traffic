# Predict Bike Traffic

## Motivation
Cycling is considered to be more environmentally sustainable than the use of private vehicles and offers greater flexibility and accessibility compared to public transportation. Additionally, rising fuel costs and public transportation fares have further incentivized individuals to turn to bicycles as a mode of transportation. To accommodate this shift in travel patterns, authorities are keen to understand which factors drive individuals to choose bicycle transportation, how urban development can generate new demand for cycling, and how to promote bicycle usage through strategies such as the installation of dedicated bike infrastructure.

## Task
 Predicting the volumn bike traffic based on social and environmental factors including residential density, amenity distribution, and street networks (length, connections, street types).
